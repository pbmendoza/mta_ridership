# Local Pipeline Scripts

Scripts in this directory implement the data processing pipeline that operates on **local data files** (raw CSVs stored in `data/`), as opposed to calculating results directly from the API.

These scripts are orchestrated by [`run_pipeline.py`](../../run_pipeline.py) at the project root.
